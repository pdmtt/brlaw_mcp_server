### Available Tools

- `pesquisar_precedentes_judiciais`: Research legal precedents that meet the specified criteria.

## Development

### Tooling

The project uses:
- Ruff for linting and formatting.
- BasedPyright for type checking.
- Pytest for testing.

### Language

Resources, tools and prompts related stuff must be written in Portuguese, because this project aims 
to be used by non-dev folks, such as lawyers and law students. 

Technical legal vocabulary is highly dependent on a country's legal tradition and translating it is 
no trivial task.

Development related stuff should stick to English as conventional, such as source code.
